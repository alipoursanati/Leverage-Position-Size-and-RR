This Python function calculates position size, leverage, and risk/reward ratio (RR) based on user inputs of entry, stop loss, targets, and wallet size. It first calculates the risk per trade by subtracting the stop loss from the entry price. The position size is then calculated by multiplying the wallet size by 0.01 and dividing by the risk. Leverage is calculated by dividing the position size by the wallet size. The script also calculates the reward based on the first target in the targets list and compares the risk/reward ratio to 1.5; returning an error message if the ratio is less than 1.5. It prompts the user to enter risk percentage, which is then converted to decimal and used in calculations. It is a basic example and the risk management strategy and calculation may vary depending on individual trader's preference.

It's worth noting that this script is a basic example and that the risk management strategy and calculation may vary depending on the individual trader's preference.
